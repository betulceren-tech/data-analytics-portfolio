# Google Sheets Projects

This folder contains projects where I performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation using Google Sheets on real datasets.
**Project File:** [games.xlsx](games.xlsx)

**Objective:** Calculate key product metrics and evaluate the effectiveness of user acquisition campaigns using Google Sheets.

**Tools:** Google Sheets  

**Work Done:**
- **Data cleaning & preparation:** Removed duplicates, fixed typos in game titles and categories, standardized formats.
- **Metrics calculation:** Added columns for:
  - Total revenue — total revenue per game
  - Paid users count — number of users who made payments
  - CR to Paid — conversion rate from users to paying users (%)
  - ARPPU — average revenue per paying user
  - Average Age (paid users) — average age of paying users
  - Median Age (paid users) — median age of paying users
  - Minimum Age (paid users)
  - Maximum Age (paid users)
- **Aggregation:** Added a "Total" row for all metrics across all games.
- **Analysis & insights:** 
  - Explained why the CR to Paid might be lower for certain games
  - Discussed potential reasons for differences in ARPPU between games
  - Proposed hypotheses testing approaches
  - Provided recommendations for Game 2 management based on findings
- **Formatting:** Optional formatting applied to improve readability for stakeholders or third-party viewers.

**Outcome:** A fully cleaned, structured, and analysis-ready dataset with key product metrics, demonstrating end-to-end workflow in Google Sheets from data cleaning to metrics calculation and business insights.
